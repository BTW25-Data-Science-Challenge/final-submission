# BTW 2025 Data Science Challenge

## Domain Knowledge 
* TODO What did you learn from the internet/**Papers**/etc. (please Reference them) in bullet points

## [Data Sources](data.md)
* TODO Shortly summarize Data.md
* TODO Elaborate each data source in data.md (where comes the data from, how is it collected, e.g. Scrapped, and why is it included)

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
* TODO Were Data cleaning or preprocessing techniques applied to all data or was there only model specific preprocessing? 

## [Data Analysis](data_analysis.md)
* TODO Most interesting Findings here (e.g. Feature Importance, Seasonalities e.g. daily fluctuations, did something have a surprisingly huge impact why do you think it was like that, etc.)
* TODO Further Details & Visualizations into [data_analysis.md](data_analysis.md) like what other experiments did you conduct, which findings did you discover 
    * Ideally in Story form e.g. Why did you check something, what was the result, what do you conclude from it?

## [Benchmark](benchmark.md)
* TODO here Tables that presents benchmarking results (One for Univariate Data one for Multi-variate Data)
* TODO in [benchmark.md](benchmark.md) explain experimental setup (Each model deserves its own file/section what is the setup, configuration of the model what is the idea, etc.)

## [Ensemble](ensemble.md)
* TODO Explain your idea here shortly & Compare with baseline
* TODO in [ensemble.md](ensemble.md) go into further detail how does the approach look, what experiments were conducted on which hardware what were the results

## Ablation Study
* TODO How much drops perf when removing one Feature at a time (least to most important)
* TODO How much drops performance when simplifying the model (does it really need to be as complex as we made it)

## Conclusion
* TODO (Argue that our approach is much more awesome than any that came before and that it needs to be as complex as it is)
* 

## Future Work
* TODO What would you want to do next if you could
