    "## Introduction \n",
    "Forecasting market influences, supply, demand, and ultimately prices is of paramount importance for any entity operating within a market. \n",
    "This is particularly salient in the context of the electricity market, where the stability of the grid is contingent upon the precarious equilibrium of supply and demand, with any disruption to this balance having the potential to severely impact the grid's reliability.\n",
    "Consequently, the field of electricity price forecasting stands as a subject of considerable relevance for both market participants and academic researchers.\n",
    "Historically, these predictions have relied on statistical methods, as exemplified by Contreras et al. (2003) using ARIMA models to predict next day's prices or Nunes et al. (2008) using SARIMA and GARCH models with moving averages.\n",
    "In recent years, machine learning has become a prominent feature of these attempts. An illustration of this phenomenon can be found in the works of Lago et al. (2018), who reported substantial success in employing deep learning in comparison to conventional statistical methodologies when predicting the next days prices. \n",
    "Another recent example proving the merit of machine learning in electricity price forecasting was achieved by Tschora et al. (2022). In their research they evaluated several machine learning approaches and achieved state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, they were able to illustrate the impact of specific influences of the final price using xAI, enabling an informed selection of features and input data for price prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by the BTW 2025 Data Science Challenge and many such pioneers, the following report details the work of the Dresden group over the last semester, attempting to forecast the day-ahead-price via a large range of methods to forecast time series.\n",
    "These methods encompass a wide spectrum, ranging from xAI integrated with conventional forecasting techniques such as ARIMA and ETS, to advanced models including (X)LSTM and transformer-based models, culminating in highly optimized approaches enabled by AutoML, exemplified by AutoGluon. \n",
    "Nevertheless, it is imperative to acknowledge that no single approach can attain results that surpass the quality of the input data. The following work therefore also details the groups work in collecting, preparing and analyzing data pertaining to the German electricity prices. "

    "### The German Energy market\n",
    "#### What markets exist within Germany? \n",
    "As explained by Schumacher et al (2015), in Germany, the price of electricity is primarily determined by the instantaneous relationship between energy consumption and energy production. Energy that has been produced is rarely stored in a quantity that is significant in relation to the prevailing market price. The market value may therefore fluctuate on a moment-by-moment basis in response to outages, consumption spikes, or production surges.\n",
    "This naturally introduces an element of unpredictability, which may not be conducive to the stability and predictability that businesses and customers require.\n",
    "Consequently, submarkets have emerged that offer longer-term contracts, enabling customers to procure electricity in advance for a period of up to six years, typically at a premium for these assurances. Submarkets offering electricity for shorter periods may also be established, with auctions taking place for the following day or even intra-day trading. As is the case with the majority of markets, the ability to effectively forecast various factors and, subsequently, prices is therefore of significant importance.\n",
    "It is important to note that only approximately 20% of electricity volume trading occurs on exchange markets. Nevertheless, even contracts that are negotiated directly between consumers and producers of electricity directly, frequently establish their prices in accordance with the prices set by the exchanges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Day-ahead prices\n",
    "As the main forecast target of the present work, the following subsection outlines the creation of the day-ahead price, as described in Nestle et al. (2009) and Schumacher et al. (2015).\n",
    "By midday, market participants submit their bids and offers, which include the quantity and delivery time for the following day. Based on the aforementioned bids and offers, a wholesale price for each hour of the forthcoming day is calculated.\n",
    "Ultimately, the price of electricity is determined by ranking the offers in descending order of price, with lower-priced generation given precedence until the demand is satisfied.\n",
    "The highest production price that is still accepted becomes the agreed-upon price, resulting in varying margins between producers. Evidently, lower-priced generation tends to be that, with low marginal costs.\n",
    "While renewable energy sources may require some installation costs, they do not have to include fuel prices in their calculations. Therefore, the quantity of such lower priced energy heavily influences market prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Importance of prediction\n",
    "While these dynamic factors are important for providers and customers for economic planning as previously described, predicition and planning are also curucial for the grids integrity.\n",
    "Producers and consumers are grouped in balancing groups (Bilanzkreis) as described by Dumancic (2024), with transmission system operators balancing supply and demand using positive and negative balancing. Unplanned imbalance in the form of over or underproduction of electricity in such a balancing group is financially penalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/5884/5840\n",
    "https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/5884/5840\n",
    "https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/6076/5976\n",
    "https://www.smard.de/page/en/wiki-article/6078/5852\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What influences the electricity price?\n",
    "As seen in Niedermayer (2023) and Hein et al. (2020), the installed net rated capacity of electricity in Germany is steadily increasing. According to Bosch et al. (2023) and Hein et al. (2020), main energy sources include fossil gas, lignite, coal, wind and photovoltaics. From the production side, main drivers of energy prices are therefore factors pertaining to these elements, such as fuel prices or weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Looking beyond the German market\n",
    "In a manner analogous to the operation of individual balancing groups, which are responsible for balancing the production and consumption of electricity to ensure the stability of the grid, electricity can be traded and balanced between countries. A substantial number of European countries are participants in the SMARD exchange system, as discussed by Ortner and Totschnig (2019). Consequently, the cost of electricity in Germany is influenced by the cross-border flow of electricity with neighboring countries and their respective energy consumption and production. \n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Weatherdata\n",
    "The weather is a pivotal factor in the calculation of the day-ahead price, given its direct impact on supply and demand in the energy market. Meteorological conditions, such as temperatures, wind speeds and solar radiation, influence both energy consumption, e.g. for heating or cooling, and energy generation from renewable sources like wind and solar energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "To record the meteorological conditions in Germany, three representative weather stations were selected, covering the northern, central and southern regions. This geographical division facilitates the consideration of distinct climatic conditions in the respective regions, in conjunction with other data sources. \n",
    "\n",
    "The meteorological data for these stations is obtained from the OpenWeather platform of the German Weather Service (DWD). This involves the integration of historical and current weather data, with the values from 2015 onwards being merged into a dataframe. This extensive data set is then enriched with the current forecasts for the following days, thus enabling more accurate mapping of the day-ahead price.\n",
    "While the current weather implementation provides a solid foundation, various measures could be implemented to further optimise the process: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The installation of a greater number of weather stations would facilitate a more detailed and regionally differentiated depiction of weather conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In addition, calculating an average at the country level has the potential to enhance the representativeness of the basis. This average could then be weighted with the population density and the regionally available capacity of the individual power plant types in order to better model local energy generation and demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Furthermore, the incorporation of extreme weather events, such as heat waves, cold snaps, and storms, is imperative for the analysis and forecasting of energy generation and demand. The incorporation of data on extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, cold snaps, or storms, could facilitate more precise prediction of unexpected fluctuations in energy production and demand.\n",
    "The analysis of long-term weather patterns, including seasonal fluctuations and the effects of climate change, has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy of forecasting. \n",
    "\n",
    "By expanding the analysed data set, weather implementation could be made more precise and flexible, allowing it to respond better to the requirements of a dynamic energy market.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entsoe Energy Market Data\n",
    "The ENTSO-E (European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity) Transparency Platform, launched in 2015, serves as Europe's central hub for electricity market data. Created to fulfill EU Regulation 543/2013, it collects and publishes data from over 42 transmission system operators across Europe. The platform transformed what was once a fragmented landscape of national data sources into a unified repository, providing crucial information about power generation, consumption, and cross-border flows. For market participants and analysts, this data source is invaluable as it offers insights into the fundamental drivers of electricity prices, including generation mix, grid constraints, and demand patterns.\n",
    "The German market underwent a significant structural change on October 1, 2018, when the joint German-Austrian-Luxembourg bidding zone (DE_AT_LU) was split. This necessitated implementing a data merging strategy to maintain continuous historical records, combining data from both the old (DE_AT_LU) and new (DE_LU) market configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SMARD Electricity Market Data\n",
    "SMARD is an information platform for the German electricity market run by the federal power network agency \"Bundesnetzagentur\".\n",
    "On the SMARD website there are datasets containing electricity generation, balancing, consumption and commercial exchanges available for download, and real time data is updated with high frequency.\n",
    "Furthermore, background information about these datasets and the electricity is given, explaining the types and context of available data. This is especially important for datasets which went through different circumstances or determination methods within our selected period of time, as these changes might make some additional preprocessing necessary.\n",
    "SMARD presents a reliable data source due to it being a government backed service, and the wide variety of datasets downloadable freely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stock Market Resource Data\n",
    "Since our energy consumption cannot yet be fully satisfied with renewable energy sources, there is still a need for fossil-based energy production and nuclear power. To reflect this in our dataset, resource prices on the stock market need to be considered. Trading in the stock market is not limited to companies but also includes resources. Resources like oil, natural gas, coal, and uranium are important for energy production and were therefore chosen for examination. Examples include uranium for nuclear power plants and coal for coal plants. These resources do not have static pricing and are listed and traded on the stock market. Their prices fluctuate, and the daily closing price is used for the calculations. It could be speculated that hourly values might yield better results, but sources for these values could not be found and were therefore not considered. The stock market data also has the highest rate of missing values, as there are no values for weekends and bank holidays when the stock markets are closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the idea was to include the prices of company stocks with high energy usage, but this was discarded as stock prices are not directly tied to energy prices. Additionally, selecting which companies to include would have been challenging, as it would require deciding whether to focus on global, European, or only German companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GDP and Inflation\n",
    "An example of an idea that was considered but did not end up in the final product is the inclusion of GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and inflation data in the calculations. The challenge identified with these datasets is that most sources for inflation and GDP only publish results annually, meaning only a single value per year would be available in our dataset. The impact of such a value would therefore be negligible. Additionally, a selection of countries would need to be made, and as with high energy usage companies, it would be unclear whether to use data from global, European, or a smaller set of countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Carbon Emission Futures\n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon emission futures data represents the market price of permits that companies must purchase to cover their carbon dioxide emissions under cap-and-trade systems such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). These permits, also known as emission allowances, are traded in financial markets, where contracts are bought and sold for delivery at a specific future date and with prices influenced by factors such as regulatory policies, market demand, and emission reduction targets. \n",
    "The maturity dates are set at quarterly intervals to provide market participants with the opportunity to manage their compliance obligations and trade allowances across various timeframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The settlement date for a contract signifies the last day trading can occur, after which the allowances are delivered or settled financially, depending on the contract terms.\n",
    "Each allowance grants the holder the right to emit one metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO₂) or its equivalent in other greenhouse gases. The data provides a quantitative measure of the cost of carbon emissions, which is a significant factor for energy producers using fossil fuels.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data was incorporated into the analysis because carbon costs significantly influence the operational expenses of energy generation, especially for carbon-intensive sources such as coal and natural gas. Incorporating carbon emission futures as a feature allows the model to reflect the economic and regulatory pressures that shape energy production costs, capturing a critical aspect of market dynamics.\n",
    "The data was sourced from Investing.com and specifically utilizes the Carbon Emissions Futures Historical dataset. It consists of daily records spanning from 2015 to the present, offering a consistent and detailed historical dataset for analysis. With the use of this dataset the aim is to ensure that the model reflects the ongoing trends and fluctuations in carbon pricing, which are critical for accurately capturing the dynamics of energy markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Major social events\n",
    "\n",
    "Including major social events in the analysis and prediction of day-ahead energy prices in Germany is valuable because such events often lead to significant shifts in both energy demand and supply. Social events, such as public holidays, large-scale festivals, political events, strikes, or even sporting events, can influence the daily behavior of energy consumers, altering typical consumption patterns. These events often result in changes in energy demand due to variations in business activity, transportation, public services, and individual behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "By incorporating major social events as a feature, the model is trained to be able to account for these irregular, yet predictable, fluctuations in demand. The goal is to improve the accuracy of day-ahead price forecasting by capturing the non-seasonal, event-driven dynamics that can significantly impact energy markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, major social events such as Carnival, Oktoberfest, Berlinale, and the Super Bowl were included to enhance the model’s ability to account for shifts in energy demand driven by these high-visibility social activities in Germany. These events, while not occurring daily, can lead to significant variations in energy consumption, particularly in terms of electricity usage in public spaces, transportation, and entertainment venues. For example, during Carnival or Oktoberfest, there is often an uptick in energy demand in cities like Cologne or Munich, due to increased activity in hospitality and public services. Similarly, the Berlinale film festival or the Super Bowl can lead to higher energy consumption driven by larger gatherings and public viewing events.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific dates of these events from 2015 to 2025 were manually derived based on historical records and scheduled occurrences. Each event was represented by a feature in the model with a binary value (1 or 0), indicating whether the event occurred on a given date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Covid Pandemic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 Pandemic was a very impactful and disruptive event in recent history.\n",
    "The pandemic and especially governmental containment and prevention measures had a high influence on human behaviour and the economy, therefore exerting a strong influence on energy demands.\n",
    "For instance the resulting shutdown of the economy implied a halt to production facilities and gastronomy, and the recommendation to not leave your home meant the private homes of people, who would otherwise be out for most of the day, had to be temperature regulated during day hours, whereas they might not have used their home AC or heating while at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "While certain social and economic repercussions of measures in the past are still evident today, the direct influence of political actions on energy demands is assumed to be limited to the time in which respective actions were active.\n",
    "These actions however differed in time and extent in the federal states, and a suitable dataset needs to represent that.\n",
    "Therefore, a dataset containing different types of political actions in the federal states and their corresponding time frames is needed.\n",
    "Such a dataset can be found as part of a publication containing daily distinctions of 16 types of political measures, each rated on a severity scale of 0-2 (\"free\" to \"fully restricted\"), and listed for each of the 16 federal states of Germany. [Steinmetz et al., 2022]\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset required preprocessing to be adjusted for our use case. Political measures were therefore each valued with factors of 0, 1 or 2 to eliminate measures with no or unlikely relation to energy demand, for example the recommendation to keep a distance of 1.5m to other persons, or weigh them accordingly if a strong influence can be assumed, for example closure of kindergartens and daycare possibly forcing workers to stay at home.\n",
    "Furthermore, the weighted political actions were multiplied by the population percentage residing the according federal state, to adjust for the amount of people affected.\n",
    "On days with no active political measures affecting energy demands, or on days that were not part of the dataset, the value 0 was filled in.\n",
    "The resulting daily index number was then used to create an hourly dataset by filling in all 24 hours with the daily value."

For example, some values could be updated every 15 minutes, while others were only available once per day. It was decided that hourly values would be used, and data points that could only provide one value per day would use that value for every hour of the given day. At the same time, there were days where some data points had no values, and in those cases, the corresponding value would be left empty."

    "These results reveal several key insights. First, not all fine-tuned models outperform the benchmark. We can also observe that the MAE percentage and RMSE percentage values are unexpectedly high. This occurs because these metrics are dominated by a few days, where the actual day-ahead price is close to zero or even less than zero, resulting in extremely high values. Therefore, for the evaluation, we should focus on the RMSE and MAE values instead. Additionally, models fine-tuned on the larger dataset, which includes data from 2015, tend to perform better than those fine-tuned on the smaller, more recent dataset. This may be due to the fact that, although the energy market is currently highly volatile, less volatile days dominate the market, making the larger dataset, with its broader range of scenarios, more beneficial.

    "#### Main concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) are a novel framework designed to address the complexities of multi-horizon time series forecasting. First introduced by Lim et al. in 2019 [Lim et al. 2019], TFT bridges the gap between high prediction accuracy and interpretability, making it uniquely suited for real-world applications where both performance and understanding are important. Traditional time series models often struggle to accommodate diverse data types or fail to provide insights into their decision-making processes. TFT resolves these challenges by integrating modern deep learning techniques with interpretable mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is particularly well-suited for datasets with mixed input types, such as historical data, future known covariates, and static features that do not vary with time. TFT excels in various domains, including finance, energy demand prediction, healthcare forecasting, and supply chain optimization, where data is abundant but understanding the temporal relationships and influences is critical. Its architecture is modular, enabling flexibility and extensibility while maintaining transparency in the decision-making process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Architechture\n",
    "\n",
    "The TFT architecture comprises several components that work together to extract meaningful patterns from complex temporal data. Below is a detailed explanation of its key building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variable Selection Layers:\n",
    "Variable selection layers dynamically identify and prioritize relevant features from the input data at each time step. This mechanism allows the model to adapt to changing conditions and reduces noise from irrelevant inputs, improving both accuracy and interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Gating Mechanisms:\n",
    "To prevent overfitting and enhance robustness, gating mechanisms selectively control the flow of information through the network. By suppressing irrelevant or redundant components, these gates ensure that only the most informative features contribute to the forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Sequence-to-Sequence Layer:\n",
    "TFT employs recurrent layers, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to model local temporal dependencies. These layers process sequential data and extract short-term trends, capturing temporal relationships that are critical for accurate forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Static Covariate Encoders:\n",
    "Static covariate encoders handle time-invariant features, such as demographic information or geographical context, that provide essential context for the forecasts. These encoders integrate static information into the temporal modeling process, ensuring consistency throughout the prediction horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Interpretable Multi-Head Attention Layers:\n",
    "Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on specific time steps that are most influential for the forecast. By assigning different weights to historical and future inputs, TFT provides insights into the long-term dependencies and temporal dynamics underlying the predictions. This component is especially valuable for the model interpretability, as it highlights which parts of the data significantly impact the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Fully Connected Output Layers:\n",
    "The final layers aggregate information from the previous components and produce the multi-step forecasts. These outputs can be tailored for specific objectives, such as point predictions or probabilistic forecasts, depending on the application.\n",
    "\n",

   "source": [
    "For our prediction of the day-ahead prices, we also used the open-source AutoML library AutoGluon. AutoGluon has three modes of operation: Tabular, Multimodal, and Time Series. In our predictions, Time Series Forecasting is used, as it can forecast future values of multiple time series when given previous data. A special feature AutoGluon provides its users is that multiple models are trained simultaneously to predict values, and at the end, the forecast from the best model is the output. This means that AutoGluon offers its users the ability to test multiple models and optimize the results without much prior knowledge or manual testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We provided AutoGluon with our data frame and divided our features into three categories: static data, known covariates, and past covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Static values: Data points like location that do not change over time; there is no such data point in our data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Known covariates: Data points that are known for the future, e.g., day of the week, weather forecast, and holidays/special occasions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Past covariates: Data points that are not known in the future, e.g., stock market values, cross-border energy flows.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have collected data from 2015 until now for around 150 data points, it is an enormous amount of data and presents many challenges for processing. Before running with the whole data frame, AutoGluon checks the data for various issues, e.g., too many NULL values or incompatible data types. Since we had already checked our data beforehand, these checks passed without problems. Another test is correlation between data points. If two data points are too closely correlated, AutoGluon removes one from the calculations to avoid spending unnecessary computation time. AG also automatically checks if certain models require longer training time than allocated by the user. In such cases, AG automatically skips training that model and moves on to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, AutoGluon trains many models but can also train models specifically chosen by the user. These models range from naive forecasts (which set the forecast to the last observed value) to Temporal Fusion Models and Chronos Models mentioned above. Since these models do not need to be implemented separately, no decision needs to be made in advance, and models can simply be chosen for their results at the end. AG also provides a forecast using a Weighted Ensemble Model, which takes the best-performing models from the training and combines them for an even better forecast. Additionally, AG offers users the opportunity to use different presets and hyperparameters for each model. Presets range from medium_quality to best_quality, where the duration of training increases significantly. Hyperparameters can be chosen for each model separately, or AG can use default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate these models, AG offers various metrics from which the user can choose: SQL, WGL, MAE, MAPE, MASE, MSE, RMSE, RMSLE, RMSSE, SMAPE, and WAPE. For our purposes, we selected MSE (mean squared error) and MAPE (mean absolute percentage error). We also compared the training duration for the different presets."

    "In the AutoGluon group, an attempt was made to optimise the prediction with AutoGluon by using different settings. The aim was to evaluate the performance of different approaches and to analyse the importance of additional data and external influencing factors. For this purpose, different AutoGluon presets were used, including best_quality, fast_training, high_quality, medium_quality and two customised configurations with user-defined hyperparameters (hp1 and hp2).\n",
    "The models were trained on two distinct datasets:\n",
    "1. allData.csv: A comprehensive dataset with over 150 data points per hour, providing a detailed basis for more accurate predictions.\n",
    "2. lessData.csv: A reduced data set with around 30 data points per hour, which represents whether the model can also make good predictions with less data\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the investigation of the effects of external factors on the prediction quality, the training runs were carried out in two variants. In the first variant, known covariates such as the day (e.g. weekday or public holiday) and weather conditions (e.g. temperature or precipitation) were included in the modelling. In the second variant, on the other hand, only the time stamps and the target value were used to optimise the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the effectiveness of the different approaches, a simple baseline was used as a reference point, which only used the time and the day-ahead price as input data. The aim was to determine the potential improvements in forecast accuracy through additional data points."

The investigation focused on whether less complex presets, such as fast_training, could achieve results in a significantly shorter time while maintaining a marginally lower level of accuracy under specific conditions. This trade-off between computing time and model performance is of particular relevance when models are updated with additional data at a later stage to enhance resource efficiency.

    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "In the dynamic landscape of Germany's energy market, predicting day-ahead electricity prices is like solving a complex puzzle where each piece represents a different market influence. There's a wealth of information hidden in news articles that could provide crucial additional context for these predictions. With the help of embedding models we hope to utilize this information to improve the prediction of day-ahead-prices in the german energy market.\n",

    "Related Work:\n",
    "It has been shown that the inclusion of news embeddings in the training material increases the performance of predictive models for financial markets [Picasso et al. 2019]. Furthermore, similar techniques yielded promising results for the predicting of the day-ahead-energy prices in the UK [Yun Bai et al. 2024]. \n",

    "Because there are hundreds of relevant articles each day, surmounting to an ungainly amount of unstructured information, we propose generating embeddings of these news.\n",
    "This not only allows us to distill the information into more structured and smaller vectors, but promises also to offer more easily extractible information as each embedding vector corresponds to a certain kind of information value. For example there might be a dimension pertaining to the impact of the news to the financial and energy market, and another to the likelihood of large energy consumption due to social events. This way the model can learn to give more importance to these potentially higher correlated dimensions.\n",
    "First we identify a suitable embedding model, which is suitable for our experiment. Secondly, we identify potential data sources and evaluate them based on their availibility, openness and finally how well their data allows us to predict the target. For this we test on a small dataset of 30 days. Thirdly, we create news embeddings from the last 10 years, to learn a Deep Learning Model and compare its performance to a baseline model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Embedding Model:\n",
    "We identified the \"all-MiniLM-L6-v2\" embedding model as a suitable candidate for this experiment [https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2]. It runs fast and thus suitable for fast experimentation, creating a 384-dimensial vector for each input text. Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) we further reduced this dimensionality to 8, for faster experimentation. In the future a comparison of different embedding models, with different dimensionalities would be interesting, or even an embedding model finetuned on the downstream task of predicting energy prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Sources:\n",
    "When identifying news sources, we had to ensure the following\n",
    "- API needs to be stable \n",
    "- Historical news articles need to be accessible back to 01.01.15\n",
    "- API needs to be affordable for the purposes of the student project\n",
    "- news articles need to be relevant\n",
    "\n",
    "First we identified NewsAPI (https://newsapi.org/) as a reliable and structured daily news source, offering a wide range of different news sources, which can be queried by keywords. Unfortunately they only offer 30 days of free historical data, and their paid plan is quite expensive. Searching through this list of curated news-apis (https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis?tab=readme-ov-file#news) however, yielded another comoprehensive news source, the guardian news api (https://open-platform.theguardian.com/). This european trust and donation based newspaper offers its extensive global news free of charge.\n",
    "We queried these news sources with \"energy OR electricity OR power market OR renewable\", and embedded the resulting articles with our chosen embedding model. In case there were multiple articles for the same hour, we created embeddings for each of them and took the mean, similar to [Picasso et al. 2019]. Next, we forward filled the embeddings to have no NaN values. Finally we appended the day ahead prices and the target. A third dataset consists only of the day ahead prices and the target, to offer a baseline to compare to. This resulted in 3 datasets. We trained the models on 30 days, as this was the maximum range of data we could fetch from NewsAPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "30 day datasets:\n",
    "- newsAPI embeddings + day-ahead + target -> RMSE: 28.82\n",
    "- Guardian embeddings + day-ahead + target -> RMSE: 27.36\n",
    "- day-ahead + target (baseline) -> RMSE: 27.86\n",
    "\n",
    "The is only a small mean difference between the results, which is probably due to the fact that the guardian and newsAPI articles hold little overall relevance regarding the german energy market.\n",
    "When looking at qualitative samples (prediction on 1 day only), we can see very localized performance increases in the embedding enriched models, indicating that the embeddings offer significant information gain when there were relevant articles available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Future experimentation into this interesting approach, especially regarding the curation of more relevant news sources, could yield more significant results."

    "#### Predicting Intraday-Prices as additional feature\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides day-ahead prices, which are the target value of this time series forecast, electric energy is also traded on the more short-term Intraday market.\n",
    "While in general a high correlation of these prices can be assumed, as they refer to the same underlying product, there are cases in which the prices of day-ahead and intraday trades differ significantly, as the intraday market will react more short-term to unforeseen changes in supply and demand.\n",
    "These short-term differences can for example be induced by\n",
    "- extreme weather conditions offsetting forecasted and actual generation of renewables affecting supply\n",
    "- extreme weather conditions generating an unforeseen surge or decline in demand\n",
    "- unplanned power plant outages creating a lack of supply\n",
    "- short-term changes in balancing affecting supply\n",
    "\n",
    "As Germany saw their share of renewables in power generation rise, the role of intraday prices for demand regulation became increasingly important.\n",
    "Therefore the \"gate closure\" of intraday trades, meaning the time between end of trading and delivery, got shortened significantly.\n",
    "In July 2015 it was changed from 45 to 30 minutes, whereas nowadays it's down to 5 minutes, and allows for a high reactivity to changes in supply and demand. [Smard, Großhandelspreise]\n",
    "\n",
    "Given our time series dataset with all features that resulted from data gathering, we tried to predict the intraday price to use as an additional feature in predicting the day-ahead price.\n",
    "If we were to predict the intraday prices with high accuracy, this could possibly be an important feature for improving the day-ahead prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Sources:\n",
    "The open data sources for intraday electric energy prices are unfortunately very limited, as in many cases stock market data are sold for commercial data analysis.\n",
    "\"Netztransparenz\", which is an information transparency platform by the four German transmission grid operators, publishes a dataset with quarter-hourly intraday price indices from 30th June 2020 to date.\n",
    "These values are calculated as volume-weighted average of the last stock market orders over 500MW for quarter-hourly electricity.\n",
    "The dataset of Netztransparenz appears to be the only freely available dataset for German intraday electricity prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "To investigate the potential of using intraday prices as an additional feature for day-ahead price prediction, a systematic approach was followed, involving the prediction of intraday prices and their integration into the day-ahead prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "All models were consistently trained and evaluated on the allData.csv and lessData.csv datasets. Each configuration of AutoGluon presets (fast_training, medium_quality, high_quality, best_quality) was used to ensure a robust evaluation of performance under varying computational and accuracy constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain consistency with the day-ahead price data and simplify analysis, the quarter-hourly intraday price data was aggregated into hourly values. This was achieved by calculating the mean of the four quarter-hourly values for each hour, resulting in a manageable dataset with hourly intraday prices that could be used for model training and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that a baseline model was developed on existing datasets and model presets to establish a reference point for evaluating and comparing the results of integrating predicted intraday prices into the day-ahead price forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to demonstrate the potential improvement in day-ahead price prediction accuracy, historical intraday prices were incorporated into the baseline model as known covariates. This step simulated a scenario where intraday prices were perfectly predicted and used to enhance the day-ahead forecast.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: add plots\n",
    "\n",
    "The two bar charts compare the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) across different AutoGluon model presets for two datasets: one with comprehensive features (allData.csv) and one with reduced features (lessData.csv). In both cases, the purple bars represent the baseline models, while the yellow bars show the results when historical intraday prices are included as a known covariate. For the larger dataset, including intraday prices consistently improves prediction accuracy across all presets, with the most significant reductions in MAPE observed for the medium_quality, high_quality, and best_quality presets, demonstrating the value of the additional feature. In contrast, for the reduced dataset, the benefits of including intraday prices are less pronounced. The fast_training preset shows no improvement, and the high_quality preset even experiences a slight increase in MAPE. However, small gains are observed for the medium_quality and best_quality presets. Overall, the inclusion of historical intraday prices proves more impactful for the larger dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on the observed improvement in day-ahead prediction performance when using historical intraday prices, the next step was to predict intraday prices for the same time intervals as those targeted in the day-ahead price forecast. Various models and train-validation-test splits were explored, with the best results achieved using the best_quality AutoGluon preset. This configuration resulted in a mean Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 93.65 and a mean Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 9.85 for intraday price prediction, demonstrating a reasonable level of accuracy in capturing short-term price dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: add plots comparing results using different model presets \n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the value of these predicted intraday prices, they were integrated as known covariates into the day-ahead price prediction models. Using the medium_quality preset and the allData.csv dataset, the day-ahead prediction model achieved a MAPE of 6.06 when incorporating the predicted intraday prices described above as input features. This result highlights that even predicted intraday prices, despite not being perfectly accurate, can still significantly enhance the day-ahead forecasting accuracy, emphasizing their potential as a valuable feature in energy price prediction tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "Team Structure and Initial Organization:\n",
    "The BTW25 student challenge presented a unique opportunity to work in a large-scale collaborative environment with 12 team members. To effectively manage this substantial team size, we implemented a strategic division into three specialized groups, each focusing on critical aspects of the project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- XAI and Data Preparation Group: Focused on explainable AI approaches and foundational data analysis\n",
    "- AutoGluon and Preprocessing Group: Concentrated on implementing solutions using AutoGluon and gathering data\n",
    "- Deep Learning Models Group: Dedicated to developing complex neural network architectures\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges of Interdependent Workflows:\n",
    "One of the primary challenges we faced was managing the interdependencies between these groups. Each team's output served as essential input for others, creating a complex web of dependencies. For example, the data fetching and preparation team's work directly impacted both the XAIs ability to explore the data and the deep learning team's capacity to develop their architectures. This interconnected structure meant that delays or changes in one group could create ripple effects throughout the entire project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Team Communication and Coordination:\n",
    "To address these challenges, we implemented an \"ambassador\" system. Members of the AutoGluon team were designated as liaisons to other groups, attending their meetings and serving as communication bridges. This approach proved invaluable for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Real-time awareness of progress and challenges across all teams\n",
    "- Immediate feedback on compatibility issues between different components\n",
    "- Rapid dissemination of important updates or changes\n",
    "- Prevention of duplicate efforts across groups\n",
    "\n",
    "Standardization and Technical Integration:\n",
    "A crucial aspect of our success was the implementation of strict technical standards:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Format Guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardized CSV formats for time series data\n",
    "- Consistent datetime formatting across all datasets\n",
    "- Uniform naming conventions for features and target variables\n",
    "- Desired range of data\n",
    "- Clear separation of train/val/test splits\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Wrapper Standardization:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common interface for all models regardless of underlying implementation\n",
    "- Standardized prediction output formats\n",
    "- Unified evaluation metrics and reporting structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective Project Management Practices\n",
    "To maintain coherence across the large team, we established several key management practices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regular all-hands meetings for high-level coordination\n",
    "- Dedicated communication channels for each subgroup\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Outcomes and Best Practices\n",
    "This experience provided valuable insights into managing large-scale ML projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The importance of clear communication channels and protocols\n",
    "- The value of standardized interfaces between different components\n",
    "- The effectiveness of cross-team ambassadors in maintaining project coherence\n",
    "- The necessity of flexible yet structured organization in academic projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact on Project Success\n",
    "These organizational strategies significantly contributed to our project's success by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimizing integration issues between different components\n",
    "- Reducing redundant work across teams\n",
    "- Enabling rapid problem identification and resolution\n",
    "- Fostering knowledge sharing across specialization boundaries\n",
    "- Creating a cohesive final product despite the complexity of multiple approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "The experience demonstrated that effective organization and communication structures are as crucial to project success as technical expertise, particularly in large-scale academic collaborations.\n"
