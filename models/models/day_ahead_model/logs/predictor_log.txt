train_data with frequency 'None' has been resampled to frequency 'h'.
Provided train_data has 78049 rows (NaN fraction=0.0%), 1 time series. Median time series length is 78049 (min=78049, max=78049). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
